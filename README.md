# CrazyVM
## 32bit virtual machine written in Rust!

This is my first attempt at writing a VM, and 
an assembly language, assembler, and in the future
a programming language with a compiler! The inspiration for
this project came from Tsodings [BM](https://github.com/tsoding/bm), and Tom Marks' [rust-simple-vm](https://github.com/phy1um/rust-simple-vm)

## Features of this project
 - A simple VM that interprets the instructions [below](#instructions)
 - A simple assembler for this VM
 - Emulated CPU architecture

## Flag register
 - First bit is logical condition flag

## Todo
 - Labels
